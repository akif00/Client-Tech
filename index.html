                our practice and how our firm is run. We believe that law must conform and change as we change and for this reason, we constantly challenge the core and limits of family law.

                Our NewYork Spousal Support Lawyers are well aware that alimony or spousal support are payments one person pays to the other after separation. These spousal support payments are usually calculated based on the difference between the couple’s net incomes.
                Important factors that determine the amount and duration of spousal support in NewYork are: 1) the length of the marriage or common law relationship 2) the disparity of the couple’s incomes 3) whether the couple have children and 4) the
                role each person played during the marriage or common law relationship.

                NY Child Support is the right of the child. It’s not your right. It’s not your spouse’s right. So when you think about Child Support, think about your child benefiting from it. Even if you think a large portion of child support is being spent on your
                ex and not just the child. Hey, it’s all about standards of living. If you are living large and have a child with someone, then that person and the child are entitled to some of your goods. And trust me, we always underestimate just how
                expensive it is to raise a child in NewYork. Anyways, you need to make sure you are either paying or receiving the right child support amount.

                    <p>
                        We successfully argued 100% reapportionment of the family assets, obtained over $100,000 for damages, in addition to being awarded special costs which are extremely rare in family law cases.

                        In a case involving short terms marriage and long term separation we successfully argued spousal support, $20 000 in child support, and $300 000 for property division despite 17 years of separation and only 5 years of marriage.

                    <p>
                        We successfully argued that the wife was making false sexual molestation claims against the husband and was alienating the child. At the end, the husband went from having two hours of supervised visits with his child, to week on/week off parenting.

                        We obtained a court Order for the wife to pay the husband high-end spousal support after ousting the husband out of the family home and leaving him without any support and out on the street.
