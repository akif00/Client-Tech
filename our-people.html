                    one of the three name partners at Gordon Schmidt Van Dyke, due to the fact that she was black and
                    female and the firm wished to fulfill a diversity quota. She made her way up the firm's ranks and,
                    after becoming a senior partner, conspired with Daniel Hardman to oust the three partners and
                    restructure the firm as Pearson Hardman, with Hardman taking over the reins.
